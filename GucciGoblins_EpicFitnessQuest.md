## üåü **WHY EVERYONE'S GOING TO BUY THIS GAME**

Imagine if **Call of Duty** had a baby with **Fortnite Royal**, and that baby was raised by **Elder Scrolls**... but the baby's babysitters were **pixies and fairies dressed head-to-toe in Gucci** who think they're the hottest thing since the Shake-Weight infomercial went viral.

**THIS IS THAT GAME.**

## üè∞ **THE LEGEND BEGINS IN WHISPERWOOD**

Deep in the mystical realm of **Whisperwood**, a dark force has emerged. Not demons, not dragons, not even the typical RPG villains... but something far more sinister:

### üßö‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è **THE LUXURY LEGION** 
- **Gucci Pixies** - Tiny terrors in $3,000 jackets who shoot designer bullets
- **Prada Fairies** - Winged warriors wielding Louis Vuitton battle staves
- **Versace Valkyries** - Fashion-forward fiends who fight in 6-inch heels
- **Chanel Chimeras** - Mythical beasts that literally turn into handbags

**These aren't your grandma's fairy tale creatures.** These are high-fashion, high-attitude, high-maintenance villains who've decided that the realm of Whisperwood would look *so much better* with a luxury shopping district and a few less peasants.
